## Introduction

The **CBMC (C Bounded Model Checker) Tool** is a powerful static analysis tool used for verifying safety-critical software. It analyzes C and C++ programs to ensure their correctness by detecting potential errors such as buffer overflows, pointer dereferences, division by zero, and assertions violations. CBMC uses formal verification techniques like bounded model checking and symbolic execution to provide rigorous guarantees about program behavior.
